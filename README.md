# GLOBAL VARIABLES

## process.env variable

'process.env' is a global variable injected at runtime by your Node.js application. It holds all environment variables as key-value pairs, with values stored as strings. When your Node.js process starts, it reads the environment variables set by the parent process or the operating system and stores them in the 'process.env' object.

Syntax:

process.env.VARIABLE_NAME = 'value';

OR:

process.env['VARIABLE_NAME'] = 'value';
